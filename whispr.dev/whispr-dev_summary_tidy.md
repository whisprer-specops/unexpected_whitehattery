# Whispr.dev launched with a bold mission:
- to build an adult content NFT marketplace and platform that empowers creators (especially sex workers) by leveraging blockchain technology.
- The envisioned platform, called “GotGirl” (or GG), was described as an “on-demand content delivery platform” where users can request custom adult content from creators and have the delivered videos or photos minted as NFTs​

## The core ideas behind GotGirl were:
- Financial Freedom for Adult Creators: GotGirl proposed using crypto-based payments instead of traditional payment processors, to “avoid censorship” and discrimination by banks and apps that often ban or restrict sex-industry transactions​
- By converting a user’s credit card payment into cryptocurrency behind the scenes, the platform would allow patrons to pay seamlessly while creators receive funds without fear of banks freezing accounts​
- This approach was explicitly meant to “protect the privacy of sex workers and allow them to access the financial world…without fear of financial discrimination or censorship.”​
- In short, blockchain was used as a workaround to traditional financial gatekeepers.
- True Ownership via NFTs: Content purchased on GotGirl would be delivered as a Non-Fungible Token to the buyer, granting them “full ownership rights” to the video or image.
- The buyer could re-watch the content indefinitely or even resell the NFT on an open market in the future​


- This NFT mechanism turns what is usually a simple content purchase into a transferable digital asset, introducing resale value and collectibility to adult content.
- Creator Royalties & Low Fees: Unlike conventional platforms (which might take 20–70% cuts), GotGirl promised to take only a 5% fee to cover costs​
- Moreover, the smart contracts for NFTs would include a built-in royalty for the creator, so that if the content NFT is resold later, the original creator automatically earns a percentage of that secondary sale​
- is was meant to continually support creators’ income – a form of lifetime royalties – which traditional content sales don’t offer.
- crow and Safety: The platform was to include an integrated escrow service. When a user requests a custom video and pays, the payment stays in escrow and is released to the creator only after the content is delivered​
- If a request is not fulfilled or is rejected, the funds are refunded to the buyer​
- This system protects both sides from fraud. Additionally, the site emphasized privacy and security – by using crypto and NFTs on a secure ledger, users could remain relatively anonymous, and creators could operate with less fear of exposure​

- A robust review system was planned to ensure accountability and quality​


## Governance and Ethics: Unusually for an adult platform, Whispr.dev planned to implement DAO governance for GotGirl, meaning the community of token holders or members could vote on platform policies and changes​
- This democratic approach was aligned with Whispr’s ideals of autonomy and inclusivity. Ethically, the company positioned itself as sex-positive and anti-trafficking, seeking to “outlaw toxic content” and promote a healthy attitude toward sexuality​
- They explicitly mention supporting comprehensive sex education and safe sex practices, and using AI-based moderation to keep the platform within ethical boundaries (e.g. preventing illegal content)​
- The GotGirl Ethical Outlook statement stresses that the goal is to give sex workers labor rights, privacy, and control, “leading the way towards a more positive cultural attitude towards sexuality”​


- In essence, Whispr framed GotGirl as not just a marketplace, but a social innovation to legitimize and dignify adult content creation.
- Overall, Whispr’s public presentation in 2023 centered on this vision of an adult NFT marketplace that empowers creators. The company name “Whispr Development” reflects building that tech, while “GotGirl” was the flagship product. They even announced that GotGirl would launch at the URL GotGirl.cam in Q1 2024​
- As sources of inspiration, Whispr.dev cited successful adult platforms and figures – for example, they give thanks to Chaturbate, MintStars, and Clipto.io (all platforms for adult content or NFTs) as trailblazers in the space​
