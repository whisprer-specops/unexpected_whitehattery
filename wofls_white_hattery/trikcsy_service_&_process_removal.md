# If a lil bleeder (Service or process) is being a stubborn ghost leftover from malware/spyware/etc. and resisting all the usual Windows tools (won’t stop, won’t delete, won’t cooperate), here’s how to go full ghostbuster on it:

## Phase 1: Identify & Prepare
First let’s make sure we’re not nuking something critical:
pop open either task mgr [ctrl+alt+del]/rhgt clk tskbar, or process mgr [ctrl+hsift+esc]

process mgr useful to note if trigger-start/manual, auto, repeat etc. - know if likley to return after restart...
Mnay things that are just per-user services or leftover cloned UID instances form, likely from bad install and honestly just accidental.
anyways, if you don't want it and you're _+certain_ it's not needed and you want it gone, then;

## Phase 2: Kill the Service
- Step 1: Get the exact service name
bash
`tasklist`
or
`tasklist | findstr suspiciousname`

or, someone super resource hungy?
`Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 20 Name, Id, CPU, Description`

or, want a real good check who's lurkin?
`Get-Process | Sort-Object Name | Format-Table Name, Id, Description -AutoSize`

and if you decide you nee the full command line path of one, just to check deeper into it:
`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Select-Object Name, CommandLine`

So what's a suspicious name?
- Process with No Description or Weird Name
That’s a red flag. Especially ones like:
`OneSyncSvc_XXXX`
`DeviceFlowUserSvc_XXXX`
`PenService_XXXX`
`xxxxxService_xxxxx`
- anything with underscores,
- random suffixes,
- empty descriptions


- Step 2: Open Command Prompt (Admin)
Press `Win + X` → Command Prompt (Admin) or Windows Terminal (Admin)

- Step 3: Stop the service forcibly
cmd
`sc stop xxxxxService_xxxxxx`
If that doesn’t work, try:
cmd
`taskkill /f /pid [PID]`
You can get the PID via:
cmd
`sc queryex xxxxxService_xxxxx`


## Phase 3: Delete the service
Still in admin terminal:
cmd
`sc delete xxxxxService_xxxxx`
If it tells you access is denied, do the next steps:

## Phase 4: Force delete with Sysinternals
- Download Sysinternals Suite:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite
- Launch Autoruns.exe as Administrator
- Look for xxxxxService_xxxxxx under Services tab
(You can Ctrl+F to find it fast)
`Right-click → Delete` (or uncheck for disable)

## Phase 5: Remove Registry Entries (optional but thorough)
- Be careful with this step.
- Open `regedit.exe` as Administrator
- Navigate to:
sql
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P9RdrService_85a94`
`Rgt-clck` the key → Delete

# Final Cleanup
- Reboot the system after all this.
- Double-check that the service is gone from:
- `services.msc`
- `Task Manager` → Services
- Autoruns

If even all that fails, you _can_ do:
- Live kernel service handle hunt
- Scheduled task kill
- Windows Recovery commandline deletion before boot

we’ll make it bleed or vanish. Your call.


### PLAN B: Sysinternals: Process Explorer
- The legendary tool. Like Task Manager but with dark wizardry:
- Download from Microsoft: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer
- Run it (no install needed)
- You’ll get full paths, parent processes, command-line args, even DLLs loaded

### start identifying outliers by:
- Missing descriptions
- Weird command lines
- Unusual parent-child process trees
- Network or disk activity spikes

And of course, we then go full detonation protocol if needed:
powershell
`Stop-Process -Name "susname" -Force`
